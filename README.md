 Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/haceru1337/windows-cache-cleaner.git
   cd windows-cache-cleaner

Step 2: Install Python
If you don't have Python installed, follow these steps to install it from the Microsoft Store:

Open the Microsoft Store.
Search for "Python".
Select the latest version of Python from the results (e.g., Python 3.10).
Click on "Get" to install it.
Alternatively, you can download Python from python.org and follow the installation instructions.

Step 3: Run the Script
Open a command prompt or PowerShell.

Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository:

Usage
The script will scan common directories like Temp, Downloads, and Documents for unnecessary files (e.g., .tmp, .log, .bak), display them, and ask for your confirmation before deletion.

Note
Make sure to review the list of files before confirming the deletion to avoid accidentally deleting important files.
